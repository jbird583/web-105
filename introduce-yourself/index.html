        <p>My name is Jeremiah Philip Bird, I am 30 years old, and I have a bunch of interest, some of which people consider odd. I will tell you about a couple of them and go into some detail about how I came into them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Storm Chasing/Storm Spotting</li>
            <li>Windows Clients (both software and hardware)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My favorite pastime activity is storm chasing. I've had a passion for storms since I can remember. As almost all little kids are, I was once petrified of storms, but getting over my fear lead me to enjoying them.<br></p>
        <p>My second favorite thing in the world is electronics, but more specifically computers. I had gotten my first computer when I was just nine and had built my first computer at the age of twelve. They have made computer building a lot simpler in time, but I get the same enjoyment regardless.</p>
