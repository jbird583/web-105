        <p>As a young child, I've always had a fascination with anything electrical. I remember my father having an old IBM desktop computer that cost him somewhere in the $2,000 range.<br>
        I would always ask him to play educational games on it. After completing the games a handful of times, I would get bored of them, so I would read his books on DOS and mess around<br>
    with the command prompts.</p>
    <p>Years of at-home experience and tinkering, I finally landed a job working for a managed service provider called Leading IT. The job is almost everything I've been doing since I was<br>
    a child, but now I get paid to have fun.</p>
    <p>My duties are primarily setting up new devices for users, which includes installing the operating systems, programs and software, setting up the user's profile on the local<br>
    domain, and also installing any additional hardware the client purchased with the machines. As always with the technology world, there is always room to expand and learn.</p>
