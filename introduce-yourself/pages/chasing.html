        <h2>Storm Chasing</h2>
        <p>My first personal encounter with a tornado was January 7, 2008. It was right after school had gotten out during my senior year in high school.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The National Weather Service had rated the tornado as an EF3</li>
            <li>The tornado had a path of approximately 13.2 miles</li>
            <li>The approximate width of the tornado was 100 yards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The weather pattern was unusual for the time of year which caused the frontal boundary of the storm system to erupt into a severe storm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It was early January, but 60 degrees</li>
            <li>There was a cold front in front of the system and all the cold moisture on the lower levels caused severe instability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My second most memorable tornado encounter was my most recent, and one that changed my mindset on chasing in general.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fairdale, Illinois on April 9, 2015</li>
            <li>This was rated an EF4 tornado with 200 miles per hour wind speeds, a width of 700 yards, and stretching as far as 30 miles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This storm was enormous on radar and had everyone on edge as the National Weather Service put out a 10 percent hatch over the area.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I was chasing alone this afternoon, which is something I normally never do</li>
            <li>After seeing massive destruction, my adrenaline wore off, and fear started to sink in</li>
        </ul>
