    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>I will be reviewing the 1996 classic, Twister, which stars the late Bill Paxton and Hellen Hunt. This film has been one of my favorites as early as I can remember and has helped me not only concur my fear of severe storms, but also started my passion for storm chasing.</p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2>The Group</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>The characters of the main group, which are actually a well known bunch, star, but are not limited to; the late Bill Paxton as Dr. Bill Harding, Helen Hunt as Dr. Joanne Thornton, Jami Gertz as Dr. Melissa Reeves, Cary Elwes as Dr. Jonas Miller, and of course the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dustin Davis.<br>
        Billy (Paxton) and Jo (Hunt) were once a married couple who found divorce prior to the start of the film. Dr. Reeves (Gertz) is Bill's new wife and is a therapist, so severe storms are outside of her field of expertise. Dusty (Hoffman) is the clown of the bunch, and Hoffman portrays the character so well.<br>
        Dr. Miller (Elwes) is the "evil" character who used to be one of the others, but then moved on for to a bigger team who was professionally sponsored. Bill Harding put it as "he is in it for the money, not the science." and there is some truth to that in today's scientific research for the prediction of severe storms as well.</p>

        <h3>My favorite scene</h3>

            <p>One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the group is at a drive in theater. They had just finished chasing a <b>handful</b> of storms that afternoon, and they booked a motel to rest for the evening. Some of the members are watching the film, some of them are at a concession stand talking, and the rest are doing their own thing.<br>
                A couple members of the group notice the calm in the dark night sky. Just as this erie calm comes, Dusty hops out of the vehicle and notifies the rest of the group that <q>it's coming.</q> As Bill explains in the next line, it was too late. <q>It's already here!</q> <em>-Billy.</em> The group then goes into survivor mode, yells at the bystanders to take shelter, and then proceed to take shelter themselves.<br>
                This is one of my favorite scenes because it goes to show you that no matter how much research we have, or how prepared you are, disaster can strike at any given moment. The group survives the spontaneous tornado destruction, but as soon as they all recover, they notice the storm is heading directly towards Wakita, Kansas, a town where Jo's aunt, Meg, lives.<br>
                The group scatters to get into their vehicles, <small>or those that are left after the chaos,</small> and flee towards aunt Meg to make sure she is alright. <mark>Another reason this scene is my favorite is because it shows that no matter how passionate you are about something, when the time comes, you go into disaster recovery mode.</mark> <b>I have a few personal experience with this.</b></p>
