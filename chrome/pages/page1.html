        <h2>Fairdale, Illinois, April 9, 2015</h2>
        <img src="../images/blue.jpg"</img>
        <p>On the morning of April 9, 2015, I had already knew of the high risk for storms that were going to occur that day. We are normally put in marginal risks, or grater, but never really see much.<br>
            After studying the forecast and seeing what all of the models had predicted, I found a target area and stationed myself in the Amboy, IL area. Normally I don't chase alone, but on this day, I had no other choice.</p>
        <p>After sitting in Amboy for what felt like days, the storms stared to roll in. I had instinct to jump north to the Pecatonica area as that was where the main severe threat was, but because I hesitated, it was too late and I decided to stay put.<br>
            As the line of storms approached in the early evening hours, I followed pursuit to the south. Little did I know there was already a tornado on the ground.</p>
        <h3>The destruction</h3>
        <p>As I was following the storm at a greater distance than normal, I had started to notice debris on the ground and some slight destruction. I got extremely excited as I had now realized something was on the ground.<br>
            Normally, it would be a smaller EF0 or EF1 tornado, because that's just how northern Illinois works. As I sped up and gained ground on the storm, I started to see what could be a large wedge tornado to my north east.<br>
            After observing the structure, and finally realizing it <en>was</en> a tornado and not just a low hanging wall cloud of great size, the adrenaline started to flow even more and I got extremely close to the storm. Closer than anyone would like to be, even those who chase storms professionally.<br>
            I was in a 2013 Chevy pickup truck with major modifications that would protect me from some severe storm damage, but it nothing special that would hold up to destruction of a storm this size. Regardless, I was in full attack mode and kept pushing.<br>
            After some time, and a <b>lot</b> of damage, my adrenaline started to wear off and I had come to realize just how idiotic and foolish I have been the last thirty plus minutes.<br>
            This was the moment that changed my chasing career forever.</p>
