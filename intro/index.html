    <h2>Why I am taking Web-105 at McHenry County College</h2>
    <p>I am taking Web-105 at McHenry County College because I have always been interested in coding languages.
        I am also taking this course because it is a core course for my AAS in Network Security.
        As I have already taken CDM-110 with Dr. Engel, I understand the basiscs of HTML coding along with the teaching style the instructor offers.</p>
